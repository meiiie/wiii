"""Phase 25 run-state machine — Runtime Migration #207.

Locks the contract:
- Legal transitions follow the documented graph.
- Illegal transitions raise IllegalTransitionError + don't mutate state.
- RETRYING bumps attempt count and clears prior error.
- Terminal states cannot transition.
- Listeners receive (prev, next, machine) and exceptions don't block.
- Retry policy backoff grows exponentially.
