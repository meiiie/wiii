"""OTLP gRPC span exporter — optional Phase 24 backend.

Phase 29 of the runtime migration epic (issue #207). Phase 24 shipped
the in-process tracing primitives (Span / Trace / Processors) and
three local processors (InMemory, Logging, MetricsForwarder). The
final missing piece for SOTA observability parity is exporting spans
to an external OTLP collector — the standard for distributed tracing
backends (Jaeger, Tempo, Datadog Agent, Honeycomb, etc.).

This module is intentionally **optional**:
- The ``opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc`` package is NOT in
  requirements.txt. It is a soft dependency installed on the deploy
  target when the team chooses an OTLP backend.
- When the lib is missing, importing this module still succeeds; the
  exporter just refuses to register and logs a no-op warning.
- When the lib is installed AND the feature flag is on, every ended
  span is forwarded to the configured OTLP endpoint as a real OpenTelemetry
  span (with trace_id, span_id, parent_span_id, timestamps, attributes).

Why route through Wiii's own ``Span`` type instead of using the OTel
SDK directly:
- Phase 24 ships before this module — Spans are already populated by
  the runtime hot path. Switching that path to OTel SDK creates a
  behavioural divergence (different ContextVar, different end()
  semantics, different status enum). Routing the exporter as a
  Phase 24 ``SpanProcessor`` keeps one source of truth.
- The conversion is a few lines and lives entirely inside this
  module — easy to delete when the team commits to OTel SDK
  end-to-end.

Out of scope today:
- Sampling — exports 100% today. When the SLO requires it, sample at
  the processor with a Bernoulli check on trace_id.
- Resource attributes from ``OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`` env — the
  SDK already does this; we read it through the SDK if available.
- Async batching — uses the SDK's ``BatchSpanProcessor`` which
  already batches + retries with backoff.
