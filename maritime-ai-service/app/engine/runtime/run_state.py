"""Run-state machine for chat dispatch.

Phase 25 of the runtime migration epic (issue #207). The legacy chat
path goes ``request → orchestrator.process → response`` as a flat call;
``native_chat_dispatch`` (Phase 19) added durable logging + metrics +
tracing around it but keeps the same flat shape. That's fine for a
single-shot turn, but it leaves three things implicit:

1. **State transitions.** A run goes through several stages even today
   (received → processing → completing → done/error), but nothing in
   the code names them. Debugging "stuck at processing" is impossible
   when the state isn't observable.
2. **Retry policy.** Provider 5xx → retry sometimes makes sense (rate
   limit), other times not (4xx invalid request). Today this is
   scattered across ``LLMPool`` + ``WiiiChatModel`` + scattered try/
   except blocks.
3. **Hook points.** Phase 27 (lifecycle hooks) needs explicit attach
   points; without a state machine the hooks have nowhere to register.

This module ships the explicit state machine. ``RunStateMachine``
manages a run from PENDING through to SUCCEEDED/FAILED with named
transitions, retry hooks, and a structured snapshot at every step.

Out of scope today:
- Orchestrator refactor — native_chat_dispatch and ChatOrchestrator
  stay as-is. They can opt into the state machine in a follow-up
  phase when retry policy or lifecycle hooks need to be enforced.
- Distributed runs — single-process today. When the runtime spans
  workers, ``RunStateMachine`` becomes a Postgres-backed entity.
