"""Cross-session episodic retrieval over the durable session log.

Phase 33c of the runtime migration epic (issue #207). Wiii's existing
memory layers cover within-session context (recent window + summary)
and slow-changing facts (core_memory_block). This module fills the
gap for "I mentioned this 3 days ago in another chat" — semantic /
keyword recall across the user's PRIOR sessions.

Primitive only. The wiring step (calling this from the multi-agent
context builder so retrieved snippets show up in the prompt) lives in
a follow-up commit so the primitive can land + be reviewed on its own.

Design points:
- **Scope to user_id + org_id** — never leak prior turns across users
  or across orgs. The session_events table is already org-aware
  (Phase 14), so the SQL filter is straightforward.
- **Exclude current session** — we don't want to dilute the recent
  window with content the conversation_window manager already shows.
  Caller passes ``exclude_session_id`` for the active turn.
- **Text-similarity for now**, embedding-based later. The
  ``session_events.payload`` jsonb has a ``text`` field for both
  user_message and assistant_message events — Postgres ``ILIKE`` +
  trigram or full-text search picks up keyword overlap fast. When the
  team adopts pgvector for session_events (separate phase) we can
  swap the SELECT for a vector-distance query without changing the
  caller.
- **Defensive on missing data**. If the durable log isn't enabled
  (``enable_session_event_log=False``, in-memory backend), this
  module returns an empty list instead of raising — the caller's
  prompt builder treats no-results as "no episodic context" and
  proceeds normally.
